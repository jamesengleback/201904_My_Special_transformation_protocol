# 201904_My_Special_transformation_protocol
### Intro
This is some more old stuff (summer 2018) that I wanted to share. The idea was that I was trying to adapt a protocol for 
[E. coli transformation](Studies_on_Transformation_of_Escherichia_coli_with_Plasmids.pdf). 

The idea of this technique is to put a circular [plasmid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid) of DNA into [E. coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli), which
has a lot of useful applications in life science.
